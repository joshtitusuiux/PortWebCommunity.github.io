							<h2>Project Brief</h2>
							Me and a group of 4 followed the design process and began by building user stories. Then we utilized group ideation techniques such as affinity diagrams, a hierarchical analysis, and wireframing. We agreed to each tackle a part of the mobile app for optimized efficiency. My part was a feature that allowed the user to calm down during anxiety. I went with a meditative interface that features soothing qualities. Upon completion, each of the 5 team members integrated their respective components into a single mobile app. We made sure to communicate frequently to avoid design inconsistencies. The final high-fidelity prototype was accomplished with Figma. 
							<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>	
								<p>Overcomplication due to incorporating a high number of functionalities and features was something that ultimately hindered our progress in the long run. Our mobile app originally intended to be a multitude of things such as a forum, a pomodoro timer, a dietary regulator, a reminder app, and a meditative guide all in one, which turned out to be biting off more than we can chew as college students. </p>
								<br>

								<h2>Research</h2>	
							<p> I led the data collected process through interviews with 4 different college students centered around their mental health.
